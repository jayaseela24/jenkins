Enable the port no.9000 in the security rules
Default credentials are admin and admin as password
Administartation---security---force user authentication- logout      // then you wont see anything.
Clickon Administrator-my account -security

         Save
Even after starting  also If sonar is not working then we need to go  to
        Cd /opt/sonarqube-7.8/logs
         ls
       cat sonar.log
ls -l /opt/sonarqube-7.8/temp/conf/es/elasticsearch.yml
if the owner is root  then
         sudo rm -rf  opt/sonarqube-7.8/temp/
 ls                           //   now you wont see the temp folder
cd bin/linux-x86-64/
sh sonar.sh start
sh sonar.sh status  --- Sonarqube is running
Go to the browser and try to access now.
When u click on the project            // once you analyze the project you can see here.
Go to the maven server and then to pom file
<properties>
<sonar.host.url>	  </sonar.host.url>       
<sonar.login> username  </sonar.login>
<soanr.password> password </sonar.password>
The command to execute sonarqube is
 mvn sonar:sonar
how to get the sonarqube report without maven,ant,gradle
Now you will see a project created in sonarqube with the name tag or else with artifact id you created in the maven.
When you click on the project you can see the full details
Click on the codesmells to see the error
Here the tag version comes from the pom file
In issues tab it defines the issues which are present  in detail with projectname/ filename
For all these languages 2390 rules are present
Under issue we click on see rule we can see all the rules present
Quality profiles-collection of rules apply during an analysis
Each language having 1 quality profile i.e., sonar way
Req- can you create a cutom quality profile with some rules
Quality profile - create 
     Name : paytm-qp-mt  ( but don’t give any space)
     Language : java
     Parent  :  None
        Click on create
Click on Activate more button which is on the left side    //adding the rule set
       “@EnableAutoConfiguration” should be fine-tuned
       “@Import’s should be preferred to “@ComponentScan”s
      When you click on the Activate button you can see the severity level
Now we are applying the created quality profiles to the project.
To select the created quality profile instead of sonar way click on setting symbol which is on the last of the quality profile.
Now the paytm-qp-mt as default for the project.
Now to assign this go to
        Project--administration-quality profile

             Select the java  paytm-qp-mt as default profile
Goto maven server
          mvn sonar:sonar
now if you run the report count is decreases because it follows only 2 rules.
Based on the requirement we can create n no. of quality profiles.
Quality Gates:  it shows the status whether it is passed or failed.
It is a collection of conditions which are going to use to apply your project for analyzing.
By default the quality gate is Sonar way.
Click on the create button for creating the quality gate and after naming the new quality gate as 
Paytm-qg-mt  and click on Add Condition button.
           Is less than 80  and click on AddCondition
If you want we can assign this created Quality Gates as default also
Assigning this Quality Gate to the project
          Goto project -click on Administrationfrom the drop down button select the Quality gate and                
          select the quality gate you created.
mvn sonar:sonar   (now here it marks as failed)
Administration  
    Configuration
        C#   file with .sh
        Java   .jav   .java   ( remove the files with .jav)
        Security   ---- force user Authentication must be in enable
  Creating a user
Security users -->
If you want to create new user then click on create user
Login :
Name :
Password :
                  Create
I f you login to the window with new credentials you cannot see Administration option tab because the user created is a normal user
So if you want to give the administration access then you need to login Administration user.
Sonar-administrators and sonar-users are the predefined groups.if you want you can create group also.
How to add the normal user as administrator user 	
   Select the bar code under the normal user in group section- select the option as ALL
Now you can see the normal users as administrator access
  Now if you go to Administartionproject - select the project if you want to delete .
   System -here you can see H2 JDBC Driver(java data base connector),compute engine,web,search engine
  Marketplace  
If your project as not having zero vulnerabilities and bugs then we cannot deploy it.
Instead of giving id and password we can give token to execute the SonarQube
  SonarQube Server-Administartor- security user-select any user - under token select the bar code
Generate the token (SonarQube token)- copy the link- instead of username we can give the token as  <sonar.login>token 
</sonar.host.url>
</properties>













































F:\practice\maven\project1>
Sonar runner   - set the env var
Sonarqube-cd /bin - start the sonar qube
Go to browser  :9000
Sonar scanner :conf/sonar scanner.properties – in this specify the project key,version ,url(near sonar source)    Sonar.projectKey=JavaProject
   Sonar.projectName=Java-Project
  Sonar.projectVersion=1.0
go to the url path  and  run the sonar
Sonar.sources=f:/practice/mavne/project1/src/main/java/devops
In maven goto  conf/settings.xml and add this
             <pluginGroups>
              <pluginGroup>org.sonarsource.scanner.maven</pluginGroup>
              </pluginGroups>
And under profiles in the same file
                  <profile>
                      <id>sonar</id>
                        <activation>
                                <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
                           </activation>
                                   <properties>
                                         <sonar.host.url>        
                             http://localhost:9000
                                   </sonar.host.url>     
                                      </properties>
                                    </profile>
Now stop the sonarqube server and run.
Goto  maven server where pom file is present and run the mvn sonar:sonar command
